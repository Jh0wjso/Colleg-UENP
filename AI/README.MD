## AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term can also be applied to any machine that exhibits characteristics associated with the human mind, such as learning and problem solving.

The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and carry out actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning (ML), which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn and adapt to new data without the help of humans. Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning by absorbing large amounts of unstructured data such as text, images or video.
